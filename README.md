Texo
====

Texo provides efficient immutable lists, as an alternative to JavaScript's native mutable arrays. It makes writing functional JavaScript easier and faster, with a simple object-oriented API. Texo allows features like lazy mapping and efficient concatenation, and it's easy to convert to and from JavaScript Arrays. Every Texo is a function, so instead of something like `xs[3]`, just write `xs(3)`.
